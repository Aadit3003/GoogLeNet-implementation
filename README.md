# GoogLeNet-implementation
The purpose of this project is to implement the GoogLeNet CNN architecture, proposed by C. Szegedy et al. (2014). Codenamed “Inception”, the original motivation behind this model was to increase the network depth while keeping the computational budget constant.
## Dataset
The Inception model was used for image classification on resized (224x224) images from the CIFAR10 dataset. The original dataset consists of 60,000 images (32x32) divided into 10 mutually exclusive classes (automobile, bird, cat and so on). 5000 training and 1000 testing images were used.
